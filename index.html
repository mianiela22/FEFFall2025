                <div class="super-sparkly-text">
                    <p>Once upon a time, in a valley where <mark>music</mark> lived in the very air, three unlikely friends discovered something extraordinary.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- <b> - bold tag vs <strong> they don't look differnt, but strong tells browser this info is important other is badazzling -->

                <p><strong>Luna the Fox</strong> had silver fur that sparkled when she heard beautiful sounds, and her tail could conduct <mark>melodies</mark> in the wind. <strong>Benny the Bear</strong> was a gentle giant who could make any instrument from forest materials and had the deepest, most soothing voice. <strong>Skye the Hummingbird</strong> was the fastest flier in the valley and could remember every <mark>song</mark> she'd ever heard.</p>

                <p>One morning, Luna's ears twitched as she heard a sad, lonely <mark>note</mark> drifting from the top of Melody Mountain. <em>"That doesn't sound right,"</em> she said, her fur dimming with worry.</p>

                <!-- <i> and <em> are both kinda used to italizize but one is for emphasis as well -->

                <p><em>"The Harmony Stone must be in trouble!"</em> gasped Benny, dropping the wooden flute he was carving.</p>

                <p><em>"We have to help!"</em> chirped Skye, already zipping toward the mountain path.</p>

                <p>The three friends climbed higher and higher, following the sorrowful <mark>tune</mark>. They passed singing flowers that had gone quiet, dancing trees that stood still, and babbling brooks that barely whispered.</p>

                <p>At the very top, they found the Crystal Cave of Echoes, where the magical Harmony Stone sat cracked and dim. Without its <mark>music</mark>, the whole valley would fall silent forever!</p>

                <p>Luna used her tail to conduct a healing <mark>melody</mark>, Benny sang deep, powerful <mark>notes</mark> that vibrated through the stone, and Skye flew in perfect circles, her wings creating the highest, sweetest <mark>harmony</mark>.</p>

                <p>Together, their friendship <mark>song</mark> was so beautiful that the Harmony Stone glowed brighter than ever before, its crack sealing with golden light. <mark>Music</mark> burst forth, filling the valley with joy once more.</p>

                <p><em>"Thank you,"</em> whispered the ancient stone in a voice like wind chimes. <em>"Your friendship has saved the <mark>music of the world</mark>."</em></p>

                <p>From that day on, the three friends became the official Guardians of Melody Mountain, ensuring that <mark>music</mark> and friendship would always fill their magical valley.</p>

                <p><strong>The End</strong></p>
