                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time, in a valley where music lived in the very air, three unlikely friends discovered something extraordinary.</p>

                <!-- <b> - bold tag vs <strong> they don't look differnt, but strong tells browser this info is important other is badazzling -->

                    <p><strong>Luna the Fox</strong> had silver fur that sparkled when she heard beautiful sounds, and her tail could conduct melodies in the wind. <strong>Benny the Bear</strong> was a gentle giant who could make any instrument from forest materials and had the deepest, most soothing voice. <strong>Skye the Hummingbird</strong> was the fastest flier in the valley and could remember every song she'd ever heard.</p>

<p>One morning, Luna's ears twitched as she heard a sad, lonely note drifting from the top of Melody Mountain. <em>"That doesn't sound right,"</em> she said, her fur dimming with worry.</p>

<!-- <i> and <em> are both kinda used to italizize but one is for emphasis as well -->

<p><em>"The Harmony Stone must be in trouble!"</em> gasped Benny, dropping the wooden flute he was carving.</p>

<p><em>"We have to help!"</em> chirped Skye, already zipping toward the mountain path.</p>

<p>The three friends climbed higher and higher, following the sorrowful tune. They passed singing flowers that had gone quiet, dancing trees that stood still, and babbling brooks that barely whispered.</p>

<p>At the very top, they found the Crystal Cave of Echoes, where the magical Harmony Stone sat cracked and dim. Without its music, the whole valley would fall silent forever!</p>

<p>Luna used her tail to conduct a healing melody, Benny sang deep, powerful notes that vibrated through the stone, and Skye flew in perfect circles, her wings creating the highest, sweetest harmony.</p>

<p>Together, their friendship song was so beautiful that the Harmony Stone glowed brighter than ever before, its crack sealing with golden light. Music burst forth, filling the valley with joy once more.</p>

<p><em>"Thank you,"</em> whispered the ancient stone in a voice like wind chimes. <em>"Your friendship has saved the music of the world."</em></p>

<p>From that day on, the three friends became the official Guardians of Melody Mountain, ensuring that music and friendship would always fill their magical valley.</p>

<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
